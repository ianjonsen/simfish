`simfish` can be used to simulate movement tracks and acoustic detections in featureless and semi-realistic environments. Users can generate an environmental raster, i.e., a raster of land and water, using the built-in `generate_env` function. This function generates both a land raster and two gradient rasters that are used to keep simulated tracks off of land via a potential function - more on that later. Alternatively, users may supply their own environmental rasters  (e.g., generated from an ESRI shapefile or similar) when a fine-scale simulation in a high-resolution environment is required.
