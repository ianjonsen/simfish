#' @title Simulate telemetry transmitter signals along a path
#'
#' @description
#' `Modified from C. Holbrook by IDJ` Simulate tag signal transmission along a pre-defined path (x, y coords)
#'   based on constant movement velocity, transmitter delay range, and duration
#'   of signal.
#'
#' @param path A two-column data frame with at least two rows and columns
#'   \code{x} and \code{y} with coordinates that define path.
#' @param vel A numeric scalar with movement velocity along track; assumed
#'   constant.
#' @param delayRng A 2-element numeric vector with minimum and maximum delay
#'   (time in seconds from end of one coded burst to beginning of next).
#' @param burstDur  A numeric scalar with duration (in seconds) of each coded
#'   burst (i.e., pulse train).
#'
#' @details
#' Delays are drawn from uniform distribution defined by delay range.
#' First, elapsed time in seconds at each node in path is calculated based on
#' path length and velocity. Next, delays are simulated and burst durations
#' are added toeach delay to determine the time of each signal transmission.
#' Location of each signal transmission along the path is linearly interpolated.
#'
#' @return A two-column data frame containing:
#'   \item{x}{ x coordinates for start of each transmission }
#'   \item{y}{ y coordinates for start of each transmission }
#'   \item{et}{ elapsed time to start of each transmission }
#'
#' @note
#' This function was written to be called before
#'   \code{\link{detect_transmissions}}, which was designed to accept the result
#'   as input (\code{trnsLoc}).
