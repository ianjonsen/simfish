Description: facilitates simulation of fish tracks in featureless and semi-realistic environments (coastal oceans, fjords, and lakes). A user-defined raster defining the water body - land boundaries is used to constrain simulated tracks. Fish movements are simulated (currently) as either a correlated random walk or a biased & correlated random walk, with the bias toward a defined Centre-of-Attraction. A potential function is used to ensure the tracks avoid land. The package can also be used to simulate detections of acoustically-tagged fish by acoustic receivers at user-defined locations.
