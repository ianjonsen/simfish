# simfish
simulate fish tracks with/without acoustic detections in semi-realistic environments

### Roadmap: 
This code is intended for generalized simulation of movements & detections of acoustically-tagged fish in semi-realistic environments. Currently, users must supply their own raster of a water body (e.g., fjord, lake, coastal ocean with land boundaries), and (optionally) a file of receiver locations. Movement is simulated as either a simple random walk or a biased random walk, where the bias is toward a user-define centre-of-attraction (a point in space). Other movement models will be added.
