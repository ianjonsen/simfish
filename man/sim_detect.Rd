\title{simulate acoustic transmissions & detection, using \code{simulate} & \code{sim_setup} output}
\usage{
sim_detect(s, data, delay = c(50, 130), burst = 5, noise = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{s}{- a simfish class list containing output from sim_fish}

\item{data}{-  a list containing required environmental data, including
receiver locations with x,y,z coordinates, where z is receiver depth.}

\item{delay}{- min & max time intervals (s) between transmissions}

\item{burst}{- duration of each transmission (s)}

\item{noise}{- range 0 - 1; simulate effect of noisy environment. Reduces detection prob w dist
by specified proportion; default = 1, no reduction}
}
\description{
simulates transmissions & detections along simulated track segments within a defined range of acoustic array(s)
